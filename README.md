# Journal-rest-api
This is a Rest API that uses Jersey and Jax-RS. You may create a profile, and post, update, delete your profile using different calls with HTTP methods. You may also do the same with enteries as well. You may use search functions to find other profiles by their usernames, location and names. You may search for enteries by their titles or by the username.
